## COVID Case Information

#### Motivation
Covid is a real modern issue and the countries are experiencing it in different ways, and thus having a transparent way to show the information is useful.

This application will show how the distribution of covid changed over time in a statistical, not geographical way.


I intitally intended to do regression analysis on the covid cases, but it turned out to not be particularly illuminating due to the spread of the cases so I omitted it.

#### Instructions
The user will be able to decide if they want to view the case amount as a percentage of the population, or as an absolute value.

If the covid value is chosen the user can then choose if the case ratio is standard or per ten thousand, hundred thousand, or a million people.

The main output is a plotly chart with the axis and ratio shown. If population ratio is chosen, the Y axis is in percent of total population.
Otherwise it is in either number of cases or number of cases per the chosen amount of people.
